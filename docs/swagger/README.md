# Swagger-UI
These files come from the [Swagger UI GitHub Project](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui). 
They're housed in the `dist` folder of that repository. We have made the following modifications: 
1. grouped the files into templates and static,
2. updated paths to match our project structure, and
3. updated file names from index.{html,css} to swagger.{html,css} to prevent collisions.
